# About Polkadot Discovery

## Project: polkadot-discovery-poc  
## SCIS Architecture

***

### Vision

Polkadot Discovery is a decentralized content discovery platform built on Polkadot’s Westend Testnet. It reimagines how users find information on movies, restaurants, travel, events, and tech by eliminating search engine bias and ensuring both users and creators have control and transparency.

***

### Core Goals

1. **Fair, Decentralized Search**  
   Polkadot Discovery uses blockchain-based tagging and filters so content is discovered by relevance, not ad spend. Future enhancements will let creators attach hashtags (e.g., #VeganEats, #IndieFilm) for better decentralized discoverability.

2. **Dynamic, ML-Enhanced Exploration**  
   Machine Learning detects the user’s topic (e.g., “thriller movies”) and loads context-driven filters—creating a personalized, responsive search experience. On-chain data guarantees privacy and user ownership.

3. **Respectful, Personalized Newsletters**  
   Users get a curated newsletter—only updates that match selected filters and interests, with no irrelevant spam. This helps people stay informed without notification overload.

### How It Works

- **User searches**: Any keyword or phrase (e.g., “thriller movies 2024”).
- **Topic detection**: ML and keyword-matching assign a topic (movies, food, etc.).
- **Dynamic filters**: Relevant, topic-specific filters are loaded.
- **Content display**: Relevant data is shown, via extensible mock data sets.
- **Newsletter:** Preview and receive a newsletter matching user selections.
- **Web3 storage:** Connect Polkadot.js wallet to store and sync preferences on-chain; data remains user-owned and portable.

***

### Technical Highlights

- **Blockchain**: Preferences stored via Polkadot.js and Westend Testnet.
- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Topic & Filters**: Dynamically matched from templates and enhanced with ML.
- **Modular Design**: SCIS-mapped source files/components for future extensibility.

***

### Impact

- **Users**: Transparent, custom results and data sovereignty.
- **Creators**: Level playing field—content is tagged and discoverable on equal terms.
- **Ecosystem**: Demonstrates real Web3 use, emphasizing transparency and fairness.

***

### Why Polkadot?

Polkadot enables scalable, secure data handling and true user sovereignty, making it ideal for a decentralized search platform.

***

### Future Roadmap

- Launch to Polkadot mainnet.
- Expand with advanced ML recommendations.
- #Tagging for enhanced creator reach.
- Add new content types (books, music, etc.).
- DAO-powered community governance.
